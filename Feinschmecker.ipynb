Cook it however you like it, but with this cut being a lean muscle with just fat over the top, we think medium-rare is perfect.

Keep them covered with the tea towel while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.\\', \\'step 2Pour the milk and cream into a saucepan. Add the garlic, thyme and shallot (if using). Slowly heat the milk and, just as it is about to reach boiling point and you see bubbles appearing around the edge of the pan, remove it from the heat. Strain the liquid into a large jug, sprinkle in the nutmeg and keep warm.\\', \\'step 3Layer half the potato slices in the dish, slightly overlapping the slices and sprinkling with a little salt and freshly ground pepper between each layer. You don\\°31t have to be too neat with the lower layers, but keep some of your best slices for later, so the top looks good.\\', \\'step 4Pour half the hot milk and cream over the potatoes, then finish off layering the rest of the potatoes (arranging them a bit more carefully this time). Pour over the rest of the hot milk and cream. Scatter the cheese over the top and bake for about one hour, until golden and tender. Leave the dish to stand for about 5 minutes, then serve sprinkled with a few fresh thyme leaves.\\']\n",

Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-8 mins until smooth. Divide the dough into four balls and arrange on a floured tray, well spaced apart. Cover with a tea towel and set aside for about 40 mins-1 hr until doubled in size.\\', \\'step 2Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8 and put a baking tray in the oven to heat up. Roll the dough balls out on a floured surface into long baguette sticks about 22-25cm long, place on the hot tray and bake for 10-12 mins until puffed up and golden, then leave to cool. Can be made a few hours ahead of baking.\\', \\'step 3To assemble, split the bread down one side and neatly layer in the tomato, ham, mozzarella and rocket, if using.
