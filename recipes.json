Cook for 15 mins, then flip the hash browns, turn the sausages and return to the oven for 10-15 mins until the hash browns are golden, and the sausages browned. Push everything together to make room in the tin, then lay the bacon rashers in the space and return to the oven for 10-15 mins or until the bacon fat is crisp and sizzling.",

Fry over a high heat, tossing occasionally until softened and any liquid released has evaporated (about 5-10 mins), then tip onto a warm plate. Wipe out the pan, heat the rest of the oil and fry the eggs however you like them. While everything is cooking heat the baked beans in a saucepan or in the microwave and lightly toast the bread, then spread the toast with butter.",

Top the sausages with the bacon then spoon over the mushrooms and top with a second slice of toast. Spread over ketchup or brown sauce (or both), then squash the hash browns down a little and top each toast with two hash browns. Top the hash browns with an egg each, then top with the last slices of toast (spread with more sauce, if you like). Press down lightly on each sandwich and serve as they are or cut in half to get a runny yolk oozing out of each sandwich. Serve with a bowl of baked beans on the side."

Scrape the mixture into a bowl and set aside.",

Remove to a plate lined with a sheet of kitchen paper to drain. Return the pan to the heat and crack in the eggs. Fry, basting occasionally in the sage oil, until crispy at the edges, about 2-3 mins. Top each plate of hash with a crispy fried egg, and scatter over the fried sage leaves. Garnish with a little grated cheese, if you like, and season with black pepper to serve."

Transfer the fried l\u00e1ngos to the lined tray and keep warm in a low oven. Spread over the soured cream and top with the brynza and parsley to serve."

To get ahead, you can cook the rice the day before and keep chilled.",

Reheat the sauce in a large, shallow pan over a low heat until simmering, then stir in the cooked rice and frozen peas, if using, and cook until the rice is piping hot. Stir through most of the coriander leaves and lemon juice. Spoon into warm bowls and top with the poached eggs, the rest of the coriander and a sprinkling of garam masala. Serve straightaway."

Scatter with nigella seeds and serve with rice, grains or naan."

Stir in the mustard, then the flour, and cook for 1 min before pouring in the stock. Season, mix well and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat and stir in the cream.

Glaze the pastry all over with beaten egg, poke two holes in the top to allow steam to escape, then bake for 30-40 mins until golden. The pie can be frozen, unbaked, for up to three months. Cook from frozen for 1 hr-1hr 15 mins. Ensure it\u2019s fully cooked through and cover with foil if it\u2019s browning too much. Serve with peas or broccoli, if you like."

Add the vinegar, tomatoes, stock and beans, along with their liquid, then rinse out the tomato can with water and add that too. Bring to a simmer and return the sausages to the pan.
