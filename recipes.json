            "step 1Up to three days ahead and at least a day before cooking, season the meat generously all over with sea salt flakes and a little cracked black pepper \u2013 do this on a plate or tray so you can roll the beef in any of the seasoning that falls off. Sit the beef fat-side up on a rack above a shallow tray and leave it uncovered in the fridge, then remove the next morning a few hours before you want to cook it.",
            "step 2Heat the oven to 120C/100C fan/gas \u00bd. Put the beef in the oven on its tray and roast for 3-4 hrs until the temperature on a digital cooking thermometer inserted in the middle of the joint reads 50C for rare, 55C for medium rare or 58C-60C for medium to medium-well. Cook it however you like it, but with this cut being a lean muscle with just fat over the top, we think medium-rare is perfect. After removing from the oven, cover with two layers of foil, then leave to rest at room temperature for up to 2 hrs.",
            "step 3If you want to make the flavoured butter, tip all the ingredients except the butter into a bowl or mini chopper along with a pinch of salt, and mix well until combined. Add the butter and blitz to fully combine. Scrape out onto a sheet of baking parchment, then roll into a log shape and twist the ends to seal. Chill for at least 2 hrs to allow the flavours to develop and the butter to firm up. Will keep frozen for up to a month.",
            "step 4About 30 mins before you want to serve, turn the oven up to 240C/220C fan/gas 9 and heat for 10 mins. If you\u2019ve made the butter, slice it into about 15 rounds and put on top of the beef. Return to the oven for another 15-20 mins, or until the meat has browned and the fat is deep golden all over, then leave to rest for another 5 mins. Carve the beef into thick slices and serve with the buttery pan juices spooned over."

            "step 2Lay a couple of lettuce leaves on a plate and pile a little chicken and some of the veg on each piece. Scatter over the coriander or mint leaves, and squeeze over some lime juice. Drizzle over some of the satay dip, then roll the lettuce around the filling. Serve with the remaining satay on the side for dipping, if you like and the lime wedges for squeezing over."

Make a well in the centre, pour in 175ml warm water and the oil and bring together with a wooden spoon to make a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-8 mins until smooth. Divide the dough into four balls and arrange on a floured tray, well spaced apart. Cover with a tea towel and set aside for about 40 mins-1 hr until doubled in size.",
            "step 2Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8 and put a baking tray in the oven to heat up. Roll the dough balls out on a floured surface into long baguette sticks about 22-25cm long, place on the hot tray and bake for 10-12 mins until puffed up and golden, then leave to cool. Can be made a few hours ahead of baking.",
            "step 3To assemble, split the bread down one side and neatly layer in the tomato, ham, mozzarella and rocket, if using. Mix the pesto with the olive oil, drizzle over, halve and serve."
