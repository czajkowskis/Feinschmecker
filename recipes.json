            "step 1Up to three days ahead and at least a day before cooking, season the meat generously all over with sea salt flakes and a little cracked black pepper \u2013 do this on a plate or tray so you can roll the beef in any of the seasoning that falls off. Sit the beef fat-side up on a rack above a shallow tray and leave it uncovered in the fridge, then remove the next morning a few hours before you want to cook it.",
            "step 2Heat the oven to 120C/100C fan/gas \u00bd. Put the beef in the oven on its tray and roast for 3-4 hrs until the temperature on a digital cooking thermometer inserted in the middle of the joint reads 50C for rare, 55C for medium rare or 58C-60C for medium to medium-well. Cook it however you like it, but with this cut being a lean muscle with just fat over the top, we think medium-rare is perfect. After removing from the oven, cover with two layers of foil, then leave to rest at room temperature for up to 2 hrs.",
            "step 3If you want to make the flavoured butter, tip all the ingredients except the butter into a bowl or mini chopper along with a pinch of salt, and mix well until combined. Add the butter and blitz to fully combine. Scrape out onto a sheet of baking parchment, then roll into a log shape and twist the ends to seal. Chill for at least 2 hrs to allow the flavours to develop and the butter to firm up. Will keep frozen for up to a month.",
            "step 4About 30 mins before you want to serve, turn the oven up to 240C/220C fan/gas 9 and heat for 10 mins. If you\u2019ve made the butter, slice it into about 15 rounds and put on top of the beef. Return to the oven for another 15-20 mins, or until the meat has browned and the fat is deep golden all over, then leave to rest for another 5 mins. Carve the beef into thick slices and serve with the buttery pan juices spooned over."

            "step 1Mash all the butter ingredients together in a bowl with a little salt and plenty of pepper, tip into a lidded container and cover until needed. Will keep for up to three days chilled, or frozen for a month.",
            "step 2Up to 48 hrs and at least 12 hrs before cooking, loosen the skin of the turkey, over the breast, by pushing your hand beneath it. Season the turkey all over, including under the skin, with 1-2 tbsp flaky sea salt. (The further ahead you do this, the more succulent it will be.) Chop the turkey neck. Put the turkey in a large roasting tin or on an oven tray, breast-side up, and chill, uncovered, until ready to cook.",
            "step 3On the day of roasting, remove the turkey from the fridge at least 1 hr before cooking. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Remove the turkey from the tin and tip the onions, carrots, turkey neck and giblets into the tin. If you have one, sit a roasting rack, trivet or ovenproof cooling rack in or over the tray and sit the turkey on top. Put the lemon halves in the cavity of the turkey with the garlic and rosemary. Spoon the flavoured butter under the turkey skin, spread it all over the breast meat and as far down to the legs as possible. For a neat finish, tie the wings and legs together using butcher\u2019s string. Drizzle half the oil over the turkey and rub it all over.",
            "step 4Put the turkey in the oven, roast for 1 hr, then remove, drizzle with the remaining oil, then return to the oven, turning the tin around, for another 1 hr. When the turkey has had 1 hr 45 mins in total, check it using a temperature probe thermometer \u2013 the timings differ depending on how long you\u2019ve salted your turkey for and what breed of turkey you\u2019re roasting. (If you don\u2019t have a probe, see our tips, below.) Perfection is when the thickest part of the breast is about 65C and the thickest part of the thigh is 75C. If the temperature is lower, return the turkey to the oven for 15-min intervals and check again. Leave the turkey to cool for 10 mins on the rack, then use tongs to remove the lemon and garlic from the cavity and transfer to a board that has a moat or a platter to collect the resting juices. Leave to rest for at least another 20 mins (it will remain hot for at least 40 mins).",
            "step 5Meanwhile, make the gravy. If the roasting tin you cooked the turkey in is flameproof, put it straight on a medium heat, if not tip the contents into a large, shallow pan and put on the heat with the cooked lemon halves, garlic and rosemary sprigs. Scatter over the flour, stir to make a paste, then stir in the wine and soy sauce and sizzle for about 5 mins until it\u2019s a thick paste. Stir in the stock and all the turkey resting juices and simmer for 5 mins, stirring all the time. Strain the gravy into a jug or another pan to reheat when needed. Carve the turkey and serve with your choice of sides, or carve at the table."

The baby onions should be tender, but not falling apart. Stir these into the braise, check the seasoning again, and scatter over the chopped parsley before serving."

Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. In the same pan, brown the beef well in batches for 5-8 mins, adding a drizzle more oil if you need to, then set aside.",
            "step 2Add the onions and carrots to the pan and cook on a low heat for 5 mins. Stir in the flour, then add the tomato pur\u00e9e, vinegar and miso, if using. Tip the beef and bacon, along with any juices, back into the pan and give it all a good stir. Pour in the ale and stock, and nestle in the thyme stalks and bay. Season generously and bring to a simmer. Cover with a lid and cook in the oven for about 2 hrs or until the meat is really tender. Leave everything to cool slightly, then strain off about half the braising liquid into another container. Leave to cool completely. Can be made up to two days ahead and kept chilled in the fridge \u2013 the pie will be better if the filling is fridge-cold when added. Can also be frozen for up to three months.",
            "step 3To make the pastry, mix the flour, mustard powder, lard and butter with a generous pinch of sea salt until completely combined, then gradually add up to 250ml ice-cold water to make a soft dough. This can be done in a food processor if you prefer. Knead the thyme leaves into the pastry, then cover and leave to rest in the fridge for at least 1 hr. Can be made up to two days ahead and kept chilled, or frozen for up to a month.",
            "step 4Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and put a baking tray in the oven. Heavily butter a 26-28cm pie dish and dust well with flour. Cut off a third of the pastry and set aside. Roll out the remaining pastry to a thick round that will easily line the pie dish with an overhang, then line the tin. Tip in the beef mixture. You want the filling to be slightly higher than the rim of the dish. Brush the edges with egg yolk. Roll out the remaining pastry to a thick round, big enough to cover the pie, then lift onto the pie dish. Trim the edges, crimp together, then re-roll the trimmings and cut into decorative shapes, such as leaves. Brush the top with more yolk. Make a hole in the centre of the pie with a knife, and put it on the hot baking tray.",
            "step 5Bake for 20 mins, remove, brush again with yolk, scatter with sea salt and bake for 20-25 mins until golden. Leave to rest for 10 mins while you heat up the extra gravy."

Using wet hands, thread the balls onto the end of the skewers, massaging the mixture down the skewers in between the palms of your hands, until evenly distributed.

Alternatively, lay them on a large baking tray lined with parchment paper if cooking in the oven, or foil if cooking under the grill. Shape into 20cm-long k\u00f6fte.

            "step 1Cook the pasta following pack instructions, reserving a mugful of the pasta water and draining it 2 mins before the stated time. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a deep, non-stick pan over a low-medium heat, then tip in the aubergine. Stir well to coat in the oil, frying until softened and deeply golden all over, around 10-15 mins. Remove to a bowl and pour the remaining oil into the pan. Once hot, tip in the onion with a pinch of salt and fry for 5-7 mins until just softened before stirring in the peppers and courgettes. Cook for a further 15-17 mins until lightly browned then add the garlic. Cook for a couple of minutes until fragrant. Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and allow it to caramelise for 5 mins. Pour in the cooked aubergine, tomatoes, basil stems and half of the basil leaves. Bring to a gentle simmer. Leave to bubble away for 20-25 mins, then season to taste.",
            "step 2Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Mix in the cooked pasta along with a generous splash of the cooking water. Season the mixture well to taste and tip into a baking dish. Combine the cheeses with the panko and a large pinch of black pepper, then scatter this over the pasta. Will keep frozen, well covered, for up to three months. Defrost thoroughly before cooking, or cook from frozen covered in foil for 40 mins, then uncovered for a further 20 mins until piping hot throughout. If cooking straightaway, bake for 15-20 mins until bubbling and golden on top. Scatter over the remaining basil leaves to serve."

Cook the meatballs in batches, making sure you don\u2019t overcrowd the pan, until they\u2019re all golden brown. Put them aside on a plate when they\u2019re ready.",
            "step 2Heat the rest of the oil in the pan and add the onion. Cook for 8-10 mins until soft, then stir in the garlic, fennel, oregano and chilli, if using. Stir around for a min or 2, then add the sugar, passata and tomatoes. Swish a little water around the containers to wash out all the tomatoes and add to the pan. Season well and simmer, uncovered, for 30-40 mins over a gentle heat until the sauce thickens and the chopped tomatoes break down.",
            "step 3Heat the butter in a saucepan, add the bay leaves and let them sizzle in the butter for 1 min, then add the flour. Whisk to make a smooth paste, then add the milk, a little at a time, stirring continuously until it\u2019s all incorporated and you have a thick white sauce. Add the nutmeg and some seasoning. Leave over a low heat for 5 mins to allow the bay to infuse, whisking every now and then.",
            "step 4Keep about 10 meatballs aside and add the rest to the tomato sauce. Spoon half the tomato sauce and meatballs into a baking dish (ours was 25cm x 35cm). Top with half the spinach, the basil and a little parmesan. Pour over about a third of the white sauce, and top with a layer of lasagne sheets, breaking them up to fit the dish if you need to.",
            "step 5Repeat the layers once more; meatballs and sauce, spinach, basil, parmesan, white sauce, pasta. Pour the remaining white sauce over the lasagne, spreading it to the corners to cover the pasta. Dot with the meatballs you set aside earlier and the mozzarella, then scatter over a generous helping of parmesan and cheddar. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Or if not eating straight away, chill for up to 24 hrs or freeze for two months (defrost in the fridge overnight before cooking).",
            "step 6Bake the lasagne for 40-50 mins until bubbling and golden with lots of crusty cheesy bits around the edges. Leave to sit for 5-10 mins before serving."
